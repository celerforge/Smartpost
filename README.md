Smartpost is a Chrome extension that helps you create better tweets. With just one click, it suggests an improved version of your tweet while keeping your original message intact.

What makes Smartpost different:
* **Customizable**: Set your own prompts to generate tweets in any style you want - professional, casual, humorous, or anything in between
* **Simple**: One click to get an AI-enhanced version of your tweet
* **Fast**: Instantly see the improved version, use it if you like it
* **Non-intrusive**: Works right within Twitter's interface - no need to switch between apps

The best part? You can customize how Smartpost works. Want tweets that always include emojis? Or prefer a more professional tone? Just update the prompt in settings, and Smartpost will follow your style.

We're always improving Smartpost based on user feedback. Have an idea? Open an issue or create a pull request - we'd love to hear from you.
